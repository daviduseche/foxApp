to get started 
run vue create <vue-app> (this is the equivalent of create-react-app)
run mpm install to install dependancies
you can run app using npm run serve
the app uses vuex actions and axios to call swapi api (https://swapi.co/)
the user clicks on on of the characters and info about the character and a image will be displayed.
I also used some minimal css to make it look presentable.
